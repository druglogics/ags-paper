abstract = {While there is a high interest in drug combinations in cancer therapy, openly accessible datasets for drug combination responses are sparse. Here we present a dataset comprising 171 pairwise combinations of 19 individual drugs targeting signal transduction mechanisms across eight cancer cell lines, where the effect of each drug and drug combination is reported as cell viability assessed by metabolic activity. Drugs are chosen by their capacity to specifically interfere with well-known signal transduction mechanisms. Signalling processes targeted by the drugs include PI3K/AKT, NFkB, JAK/STAT, CTNNB1/TCF, and MAPK pathways. Drug combinations are classified as synergistic based on the Bliss independence synergy metrics. The data identifies combinations that synergistically reduce cancer cell viability and that can be of interest for further pre-clinical investigations.},

@article{Grau2015,
abstract = {Summary: Precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are valuable measures of classifier performance. Here, we present the R-package PRROC, which allows for computing and visualizing both PR and ROC curves. In contrast to available R-packages, PRROC allows for computing PR and ROC curves and areas under these curves for soft-labeled data using a continuous interpolation between the points of PR curves. In addition, PRROC provides a generic plot function for generating publication-quality graphics of PR and ROC curves.Availability and implementation: PRROC is available from CRAN and is licensed under GPL 3.Contact: grau@informatik.uni-halle.de},
annote = {R package for drawing ROC and PR curves. Feels bad to use (arg names, etc) but works ok!

- SOS: Need to have positive class values higher than negative class values (use -x instead of x)
- Supports soft-labeling (weighted) data: the observed classes can be probabilities not just binary 1 and 0!!!
- The only R package to support PR curves!
- Can add more than 1 ROC curves
- Adds color bar with thresholds

For ROC and PR it solves/computes:
1. Standard, hard-labeled classification problems
2. Weighted, hard-labeled classification problems (weights for class 1 and 0 don't necessarily add to 1 - they are extra evidence for that class!)
3. Soft-labeled classification problem (weights/probabilities for class 1 and 0 add to 1)},

@article{Pepe2000,
abstract = {When multiple diagnostic tests are performed on an individual or multiple disease markers are available it may be possible to combine the information to diagnose disease. We consider how to choose linear combinations of markers in order to optimize diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy index to be maximized is the area or partial area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We propose a distribution-free rank-based approach for optimizing the area under the ROC curve and compare it with logistic regression and with classic linear discriminant analysis (LDA). It has been shown that the latter method optimizes the area under the ROC curve when test results have a multivariate normal distribution for diseased and non-diseased populations. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed non-parametric method is efficient when data are multivariate normal.The distribution-free method is generalized to a smooth distribution-free approach to: (i) accommodate some reasonable smoothness assumptions; (ii) incorporate covariate effects; and (iii) yield optimized partial areas under the ROC curve. This latter feature is particularly important since it allows one to focus on a region of the ROC curve which is of most relevance to clinical practice. Neither logistic regression nor LDA necessarily maximize partial areas. The approaches are illustrated on two cancer datasets, one involving serum antigen markers for pancreatic cancer and the other involving longitudinal prostate specific antigen data.},

@article{Saito2015,
abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},
