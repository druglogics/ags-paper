abstract = {Discovery of efficient anti-cancer drug combinations is a major challenge, since experimental testing of all possible combinations is clearly impossible. Recent efforts to computationally predict drug combination responses retain this experimental search space, as model definitions typically rely on extensive drug perturbation data. We developed a dynamical model representing a cell fate decision network in the AGS gastric cancer cell line, relying on background knowledge extracted from literature and databases. We defined a set of logical equations recapitulating AGS data observed in cells in their baseline proliferative state. Using the modeling software GINsim, model reduction and simulation compression techniques were applied to cope with the vast state space of large logical models and enable simulations of pairwise applications of specific signaling inhibitory chemical substances. Our simulations predicted synergistic growth inhibitory action of five combinations from a total of 21 possible pairs. Four of the predicted synergies were confirmed in AGS cell growth real-time assays, including known effects of combined MEK-AKT or MEK-PI3K inhibitions, along with novel synergistic effects of combined TAK1-AKT or TAK1-PI3K inhibitions. Our strategy reduces the dependence on a priori drug perturbation experimentation for well-characterized signaling networks, by demonstrating that a model predictive of combinatorial drug effects can be inferred from background knowledge on unperturbed and proliferating cancer cells. Our modeling approach can thus contribute to preclinical discovery of efficient anticancer drug combinations, and thereby to development of strategies to tailor treatment to individual cancer patients.},

@article{Grau2015,
abstract = {Summary: Precision-recall (PR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are valuable measures of classifier performance. Here, we present the R-package PRROC, which allows for computing and visualizing both PR and ROC curves. In contrast to available R-packages, PRROC allows for computing PR and ROC curves and areas under these curves for soft-labeled data using a continuous interpolation between the points of PR curves. In addition, PRROC provides a generic plot function for generating publication-quality graphics of PR and ROC curves.Availability and implementation: PRROC is available from CRAN and is licensed under GPL 3.Contact: grau@informatik.uni-halle.de},
annote = {R package for drawing ROC and PR curves. Feels bad to use (arg names, etc) but works ok!

- SOS: Need to have positive class values higher than negative class values (use -x instead of x)
- Supports soft-labeling (weighted) data: the observed classes can be probabilities not just binary 1 and 0!!!
- The only R package to support PR curves!
- Can add more than 1 ROC curves
- Adds color bar with thresholds

For ROC and PR it solves/computes:
1. Standard, hard-labeled classification problems
2. Weighted, hard-labeled classification problems (weights for class 1 and 0 don't necessarily add to 1 - they are extra evidence for that class!)
3. Soft-labeled classification problem (weights/probabilities for class 1 and 0 add to 1)},
